We offer our two solutions in .py format (one for Decision tree and one for Random Forest classifier, which can 
be entered to jupyter notebook and executed immediately.

We also offer the notebook extraction .ipynb for each one of the above, which again can be imported in the jupyter 
notebook and show all the results and diagrams we got and the % prediction rate of our implementation.

NOTE: Each execution might take some time to run, depending on the machine specs.
